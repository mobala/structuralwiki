I've decided to start a blog to record the work I've done in civil/structural engineering. I'm doing this as a means of not only passing knowledge on to others at an earlier, or perhaps, different stage of their career, but to also pass knowledge on to my future self. Considering how much I remember about just a few years ago, this will surely come in handy. 


Accordingly, I'm developing a course plan for folks interested in structural engineering. One that follows my development as a young engineer. I'm starting out with the basic principles that were reinforced in me as I exited university and began my working career. Topics I plan on covering will include but are not limited to:

- Mechanics of Materials - Know Your Stresses
- Gravity Loads - What to Design For and Where to Look
- Lateral Loads - Wind 
- Lateral Loads - Seismic
- Foundations - Designing from the Ground Up 
- Steel
- Connections
- Concrete
- Lateral Force Resisting Systems
- Software 
- Career Options as a Structural Engineer
