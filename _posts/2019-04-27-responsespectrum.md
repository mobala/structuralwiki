A number of months ago a put together a video that goes into the covers the Response Spectrum Method as it is implemented in ASCE 7-10. My aim was to tailor the review to tailor the video to those who are not familiar as to how the method is used in code, and do so through an approach that actually shows the viewer how one can generate their own spectra. For fun, I decided to use data from the El Centro Earthquake to generate my own spectra in an IPython notebook.

If you would like to learn more about the Response Spectrum Method, or Earthquake Engineering in general, I would recommend reading [Dynamics of Structures by Anil K. Chopra](https://amzn.to/2ENuY9Q).
